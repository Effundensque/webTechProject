- our team is going to develop an anonymous grading web application with a RESTful backend which accessed data stored in a relational database through a persistence API as well as data from an external service and an SPA front-end built with a component based framework.

While we have all the description of the future web application in the two files given by the professor, I think we should start talking how it is going to be developed. First of all, each of us will have a separate branch on this repository, and after someone solves something he will commit the changes to his / her branch and then all of us will review the code and approve / deny the changes. This way, we can keep the evidence of what each of us did, easier. 

Most probably the github repo will be set to private and the professor will be contributor, but we'll have to discuss this matter.

Regarding the app, the first idea is to make some profiles and each user that registers will have a role assigned to it. Based on that each type of user will have access to different functionalities.
